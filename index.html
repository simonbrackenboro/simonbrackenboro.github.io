<h1>LCH DMP in OpenGamma</h1>

<p>
    In order to road test the OpenGamma Platform, this document discusses the actions taken to value a portfolio of
    999 &#8364; swaps using the OpenGamma Platform. These swaps were taken from the EUR_N1 LLC portfolio in the May 2014
    LCH DMP fire drill. You can find the files related to this fire drill at <a href="\\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014
    (LLC)">\\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)</a>. This allows us to use the the LCH valuations and
    <a href="http://clearing.formicary.net">Default Management Process (DMP) Portfolio Analysis Tool</a> to
    validate the results.
</p>

<h2>Quick overview of OpenGamma</h2>

<p>
    OpenGamma is a open source financial analytics platform that supports ad-hoc calculation with near real time
    streaming analytics.
</p>

<p>
    The full OpenGamma documentation relevant to this discussion is available
    <a href="http://docs.opengamma.com/display/DOC210/OpenGamma+Platform+Documentation">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We will be mostly concerned with the swap valuation functionality provided by OpenGamma.
</p>

<h2>Installing the system</h2>

<p>
    The soruce distribution is available on <a href="https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform">GitHub</a> and you can
    run the server using the OpenGamma Maven plugins opengamma:server-&#x2731; which are documented
    <a href="https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform/blob/master/README.md">here</a>. Nota bene that I was only able
    to get this working using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/docs/3.0.5/release-notes.html">apache-maven-3.0.5</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="ID">Input Data</a></h2>

<h3>Trade</h3>

<p>
    The trade data for this portfolio is provided in the FpML format a consists of 999 XMLs files
    which you can find at
    <a href="\\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)\Auction Packs\FpML\EUR_20140513_N1-fpml.zip">
        \\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)\Auction Packs\FpML\EUR_20140513_N1-fpml.zip
    </a>.
</p>

<h3>Market Data</h3>

<p>
    The LCH DMP process supplies discount and forward curves as CSV files which you can find at
    <a href=" \\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)\Auction Packs\Reports\DMPAUC-Reports-20140513_EUR_N1.zip">
        \\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)\Auction Packs\Reports\DMPAUC-Reports-20140513_EUR_N1.zip
    </a>. Note that the discount and forward curves are provided as par curves and zero curves for speed and simplicity
    of configuration we have opted to load to the zero curves.
</p>

<h3>Static</h3>

<p>
    The LCH DMP process supplies calendars and historical fixings as CSV files which you can find at
    <a href=" \\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)\Auction Packs\Reports\DMPAUC-Reports-20140513_EUR_N1.zip">
        \\gargamel\shared\Clearing\Fire Drill May 2014 (LLC)\Auction Packs\Reports\DMPAUC-Reports-20140513_EUR_N1.zip
    </a>.
</p>

<h2>Importing Data</h2>

<p>A mechanism is required to load the data (described in the <a href="#ID">Input Data</a> section) in to the OpenGamma
    system each mechanism is discussed in turn below. </p>

<h3>Trade</h3>

<p>OpenGamma supports an <a href="http://docs.opengamma.com/display/DOC210/XML+file+format">XML format</a> for
    importing trades. We will use this mechanism to import the trade data into OpenGamma. This requires us to develop a
    transformation of the trade FpML into the OpenGamma XML format. This transformation was achieved using a
    <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a> based XSLT transformation as we need the functionality to
    transform multiple XML files into a single op-portfolio XML.</p>

<h3>Market Data</h3>

<p>
    As we have already discussed we have opted to load the zero curves for the &#8364; Swap Portfolio.
    The out of the box OpenGamma solution contains an ExampleLiveDataServer that implements simulated
    real time data. Even though our curve date was not real time we opted to modify this code to load our
    zero curve data and to remove the randomisation of the configured data on each tick.
</p>

<h3>Static</h3>

<h4>Historical Fixing Loader</h4>

The historical fixings are stored in a databased backed HistoricalTimeSeriesMaster. The Server initialisation routines
were modified to also load the LCH fixing data using the code listed below :-

<pre>DMPHistoricalFixingReader</pre>
<pre>ExampleDatabasePopulator</pre>

<h4>Holiday Calendars Loader</h4>

The holiday calendars are stored in a databased backed HolidayMaster. The Server initialisation routines
were modified to also load the LCH fixing data using the code listed below :-

<pre>DMPHolidayFileReader</pre>
<pre>ExampleHolidayLoader</pre>

Note that the swap trades link to a region which intern links to a holiday calendar it is there necessary to
populate regions matching the calendars themselves which is discussed below.

<h4>Region Loader</h4>

Strangely the Region master dat is not stored in the database but rather in a hardcoded in memory version.
This was modified to load all the "new" regions from the calendar file in addition to the regions that existed
previously.

<pre>InMemoryRegionMasterComponentFactory</pre>

</body>

<h2>Configuring the valuation</h2>

The zero curves are loaded as live market data. But before they can be used by the valuation code we must define the
yield curve definition along with the associated conventions. The class

<pre>SyntheticLCHConventions</pre>

loads the curve conventions and the method

<pre>YieldCurveConfigPopulator.populateCurveDefinitionConfigMaster()</pre>

loads the yield curve definitions.

<h2>Defects and resolutions</h2>

<p>The OpenGamma v2.1.0 release was used for all the testing.</p>

<ol>
    <li>OpenGamma does not support IMM date rolls on swap trades out of the box. So we implemented the feature to get a
        correct
        match for the IMM trades in the portfolio
    </li>
    <li>The payment filtering in OpenGamma includes all payments greater than or equal to the valuation date the LCH
        valuation uses a more complex filtering logic in the case of EUR swaps only coupons paying on a date strictly
        greater than the valuation day plus 1 business day are included. The code was modified to reflect this logic.
    </li>
    <li>
        All the OIS swaps considered have a payment lag of 1 business day this was not correctly reflected by the base
        OpenGamma code and was modified to correct this difference.
    </li>
    <li>
        By default OpenGamma expects to bootstrap the discount and forward curves from the market prices. We choose to
        supply this information as zero curves directly to minimize the scope and configuration need to get things
        working. This required a code change to suppress the bootstrap code and align the zero curve
        day count conventions from ACT/ACT to ACT/365, which is the LCH curve convention.
    </li>
    <li>
        By default OpenGamma selects a single basis curve for the forward rate curve. This logic was extended to support
        selection of the correct basis curve.
    </li>
    <li>
        By default OpenGamma selects a single basis curve for the forward rate curve. This logic was extended to support
        selection of the correct basis curve. You can see the new code in
        <em>FixedIncomeInstrumentCurveExposureHelper.getCurveNamesForLCHSecurity()</em>
    </li>

<h2>Potential Future Improvements</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Work convert the currently prototype code into a more robust "production" code.
    </li>

    <li>
        Generate the Default Management Process file using a custom developed view rather than the current logging
        based solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Move code modification into separate classes that are specific to the DMP run.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add new test case to "prove" the new code and ensure that the existing test cases which are currently broken
        (due to the new changes) work.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add further portfolios to test the solution further.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add support for FRAs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add support for VNSs.
    </li>
</ol>
